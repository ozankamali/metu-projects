1. Run part3_hp_tester with command:
$ python part3_hp_tester.py

# It will display the current iterations and give information about the accuracies of the given hyperparameter configuration.
# At the end of the program it will print the mean accuracies & confidence intervals for each configuration with the best configuration and write it to the -> best_hyperparameters.pkl

2. Run part3.py with command:
$ python part3.py

#It will parse the best_hyperparameters.pkl and display the final scores & confidence intervals for the best hyperparameter configuration at the end of the program.
